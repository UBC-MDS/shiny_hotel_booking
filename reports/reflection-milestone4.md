# Milestone 4 Reflection
## Introduction
This milestone was all about improving the shiny app and addressing some improvements to the dashboard.
We received feedback from our colleges and we came up with a list of actionable items to do during this milestone.
This reflection will focus on three major aspects of the project presented below:
- Teamwork and Collaboration
- Evaluation of the Dashboard
- Areas for Improvement

## Teamwork and Collaboration
Working with the team on this visualization dashboard project was a highly pleasant experience. From the very beginning, everyone was enthusiastic about the project and committed to making it a success. We were able to communicate effectively and collaborate efficiently through GitHub issues, which made the project run smoothly. We followed the course guidelines in working with GitHub branches and the combination of clear communication and using the right development approaches made the teamwork a great experience. Overall, we feel fortunate to have been a part of such a positive and productive team, and we look forward to the possibility of working with them again in the future.

## Evaluation of Dashboard
Group 3 has reviewed our group's work through milestone 3. They found our dashboard easy to use and the use of the emojies was interesting for them.
Their comments are summarized below:
- They have mentioned that the app was easy to use, and the charts and their labels were readable. However, they suggested that the plot title should be larger than the y-axis and x-axis text size to match people's intuition. This feedback has been addressed in the current milestone.
- They found the overall plot selection great, however they were expecting a more clear plot for the busiest day mark.
- They suggested the date ranges to be filtered in the range of the data.

## Added Features
- Charts interactivity: All of the charts are now interactive and if the user hovers on the data points, additional information will be shown in the tooltip.
- Loading Spinner: Since the process of the data is a time consuming procedure, there was a need to add a loading spinner to improve the user experience.
- Download Button: In some cases, users might need to access the raw data that has been used for plots. In order to fulfill this need, we added a download button.
- Notification box: One of the most important factors affecting the user experience is having a well established communication channel with them and notifications are one of the best tools to achieve the proper communication level with user. In this regard, we decided to add a series of notifications to update them about the backend ongoing operations.

## Possible Future Improvements
- The datset in thid project had many limitation including the lack of hotel names and their city. As a potential future improvement, the name of the hotels could be presented too.
- The heatmap polygon JSON file is a heavy file for leaflet library and that's why it takes a couple of seconds to load.
- Adding more metrics to the heatmap
- The dataset was more unbalanced toward European hotels and there weren't the same records from the rest of the regions. So finding a data set that has more data from other countries hotels would be a good idea.
- The distribution of the booking price chart needs an improvement in a way that presents the distribution over different categories of hotels.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways
### Conclusion
In conclusion, our group has successfully designed and implemented a shiny app dashboard that provides an interactive and user-friendly way to explore and analyze hotel data. The app includes various features such as visualizations, filtering options, and data manipulation tools that allow our target persona to gain insights and make informed decisions. Through collaboration and teamwork, we were able to leverage each other's strengths and expertise to create a polished and functional dashboard that meets the needs of our target audience.

### Key takeaway
The key takeaway from this project is the importance of collaboration and effective communication in developing a successful data-driven solution. By working together, we were able to pool our resources and skills to create a product that meets the needs of our users. We also learned the value of continuous feedback and iteration, as we had to constantly revise and improve our dashboard based on user feedback and testing. Overall, this project provided us with a valuable learning experience and practical skills that we can apply in future data analysis and visualization projects.
