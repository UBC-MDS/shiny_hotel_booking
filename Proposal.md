## Usage scenario

As a hotel manager, you log into the hotel booking dashboard to get an overview of your current bookings. You start by looking at the time stamp on the top of the dashboard to ensure that the data is up-to-date.

Next, you examine the data on the country-wise booking counts, which shows a breakdown of bookings based on different countries. You notice that there has been a significant increase in bookings from a particular country, which prompts you to investigate further. You decide to offer a special promotion to this country to attract more bookings.

You also review the hotel-wise booking counts, which shows a breakdown of bookings based on different hotels. You notice that one of your hotels is experiencing low bookings, so you decide to allocate more resources to market that particular hotel to attract more customers.

Overall, the hotel booking dashboard helps you make informed decisions based on real-time data, which can improve your business performance and customer satisfaction.
