# Milestone 2 Reflection

## Features 

- Heatmap on map of the world was correctly implemented
- Dashboard clearly communicates what we think the user would want to see
- Dashboard is pretty to look at, not over-complicated and easy to
  read/understand
- Specific Dataset we are using at the bottom. 

## Limitations

- Map can be zoomed out a bit too much
- No buttons to select or deselect all options in the drop down
- Potentially too many countries will be listed in plot titles, need to add some
  limits to the length of those titles
- Limit information is giving when mouse move to the map, there is only average price/night.

## What was Implemented

- Added a heatmap to visualize metrics across countries
- Added widgets to specify certain filters
- Added plots that update based on the widgets

## What wasn't Implemented

- Reduced number of plots in chart box from 4 to 3 to conserve space

## Possible Future Improvements

- Incorporating more features from the dataset to plot such as a distribution 
  number of children booked in the given filter ranges.
- Adding a new page with a data table to allow users to see the data if they
  were interested in specific hotels
- Adding more data about specific hotel names, locations (cities) and ratings
- Extending our proposal and motivations
- Improving the `read_json` functionality to increase the speed of the dashboard.
